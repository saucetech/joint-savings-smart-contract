# joint-savings-smart-contract

The purpose of this project was to create a blockchain based joint savings account that leverages smart contracts to automate financial processes and features, such as the ability to deposit and withdraw funds to and from the account. The smart contract creates 5 buttons: deposit, setAccounts, contractBalance, lastToWithdraw, and lastWithdrawAmount. The functionality of each of the buttons have been tested, and screenshots of the results have been saved in the Execution_Results folder.

Set Accounts functionality based on 2 dummy addresses:
